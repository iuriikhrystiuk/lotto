# The lottery stuff

Before you start up your project, make sure:
1. Visual Studio is configured to restore nuget packages
2. You have MS SQL 2012+ up and running
3. You have MSDTC enabled

The project will create the hub data base at start up. 
You will need to configure sources for processing manually (e.g. create data bases).
